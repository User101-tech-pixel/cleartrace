# ClearTrace — $0 Static Website Starter

This folder is a **ready-to-deploy** static site for your data-removal startup. No backend, no billing, $0 hosting via **GitHub Pages**.

## 1) Deploy on GitHub Pages (Free)
1. Create a GitHub account if you don't have one.
2. Make a **public** repo (e.g., `ClearTrace`).
3. Upload all files in this folder to the repo (drag & drop in GitHub web).
4. Go to **Settings → Pages** → Source = `Deploy from a branch`, Branch = `main` (or `master`), Folder = `/ (root)`.
5. Wait a minute; your site will be live at: https://user101-tech-pixel.github.io/cleartrace/

## 2) Customize
- **Brand name**: Find/replace `ClearTrace` with your brand.
- **Email**: Replace `support@clear-trace.net` in `index.html` and `script.js`.
- **Phone**: Replace `+1 (555) 555‑0199` in footer.
- **Pricing**: Update the `Pricing` section in `index.html`.
- **Blog**: Duplicate `blog/first-post.html` for more posts.
- **SEO**: Update `<title>` and `<meta name="description">` in each page.

## 3) $0 Contact/Lead Capture Options
- Default: the form triggers a **mailto:** to `support@clear-trace.net` (works without a backend).
- Upgrade (still $0): create a **Google Form** and embed it where the contact form is (or use Formspree free tier).

## 4) Legal & Compliance
- Keep **unsubscribe** links in email campaigns.
- Be transparent: you operate under CCPA/CPRA & GDPR erasure rights.
- Do **not** paste people's leaked data into outreach emails.

## 5) Next Steps
- Write weekly blog posts (e.g., "How to remove yourself from Spokeo/BTruthFinder...").
- Share articles on LinkedIn/Reddit/Quora.
- Add social proof as you get customers (testimonials, case counts, screenshots).
